See, the below Snippet, for more info about this fork.
"R:\Chrome F12 Sources tab -- Snippets\Chrome_45-- Snippet to get All passwords, 20March17.js"

-------------------------------------
I used this Article\Fork, on 20march17 & tested the Code given in Chromium_56.

It works OK, in 56. Used the non-minified copy-paste on F12 console
& you get the passwords, in console & body, both.

but this script, does not work in Chromium_45, as there is no 'PasswordManager' in console. 
So, for Ch_45, use my Idea above, if you require. As, I am upgrading to ver53, the below script + 
the chrome://flags...enable export-import of password, will work the best.
